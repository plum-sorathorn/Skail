# AutoConduck Changelog

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-28

### Native Async DAG & Zero-Overhead Orchestration
- **LangGraph Removal & Native Async DAG (`orchestrator/dynamic_factory.py`)**: Replaced LangGraph with a lightweight, native `asyncio.gather` execution engine (`DynamicGraphRunner`). Eliminates 50–200ms of graph compilation overhead per turn and removes the `langgraph` and `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite` dependencies completely.
- **Orphan Subagent Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where the orchestrator synthesizer could complete early while background child subtasks were still in flight. All dependency trees are now strictly awaited.
- **Cycle-Resilient DAG Builder**: Implemented topological DFS cycle detection in `build_dynamic_graph()` to safely detect cyclical task definitions and degrade to fallback runners without deadlocks.

### Hot-Path Latency & Concurrency Optimizations
- **Fast-Path Config Resolution (`config/manager.py`)**: Added an `st_mtime_ns` timestamp check in `get_config()`, bypassing disk read and SHA256 hashing when `config.yaml` has not changed.
- **Immediate Progress Streaming (`server/server_chat.py`)**: Replaced the 100ms `asyncio.sleep` polling loop with an instantaneous `asyncio.Event` (`done_event`) for subagent node progress events.
- **Normalization Deduplication (`server/server_router.py`)**: Removed redundant message normalization passes in the routing pipeline.
- **Turn Guard Bounded Scope (`server/turn_guard.py`)**: Truncated message history evaluation to the latest 20 messages, guaranteeing sub-2ms classification regardless of session length.
- **Async Usage Stats I/O (`stats.py`)**: Migrated synchronous file append operations to a dedicated background worker thread and queue.
- **SLM Heartbeat Stampede Protection (`server/server_router.py`)**: Added a 60-second TTL lock on background SLM trajectory evaluation tasks.
- **Cleanup of Obsolete Compat Shims**: Removed `autoconduck/_compat/sqlite_checkpointer.py` and decoupled tests from SQLite checkpointer persistence.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-25

### Model Selection Overhaul
- **Turn Guard false-positive fix (`server/turn_guard.py`)**: Removed the "complexity drift" escalation (>10 distinct files / >30 tool turns) that misclassified healthy multi-file tool loops as stagnant, causing runaway replanning and Dynamic-DAG recompilation (the grok-4.6 cost incident). Healthy tool loops now stay on DIRECT_ACTIVE_TIER; only 3+ identical calls or 2+ consecutive errors escalate.
- **Capability-vector scoring (`routing/model_pool.py`)**: Replaced the 1D `capability_score` gate with a 4-dim `capability_vector` (reasoning, tool_reliability, code_quality, latency_class) scored by `capability_fit()` (min-with-bonus), weighted per SLM `task_type` via `TASK_TYPE_WEIGHTS`. Selection is now "fit-gate then cheapest"; legacy scalar entries fall back compatibly.
- **Confidence-tightened floor (`routing/dispatcher.py:_select_planned`)**: Low SLM `plan.confidence` raises the capability floor (`min(base + 0.15*(1-conf), 0.6)`).
- **Opt-in per-selection price cap (`CapabilitySLA.max_price_usd_per_mtok`, config `selection.path_price_cap_usd_per_mtok`)**: Reframed the earlier "USD/min" ceiling into an honest per-1M-token price cap, DISABLED by default ({}). Not a spend meter; falls back to cheapest available with `fallback_reason="price_cap_emptied_pool"`.
- **Explainability (`SelectionInfo`/`RoutingDecision` → `/stats`)**: candidates_considered, candidates_excluded_by, binding_constraint, capability_fit_applied, binding_capability_dim, spend_cap_engaged, fallback_reason.

### Notes
- Version bumps now via `python scripts/bump_version.py --patch`.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-08-25

### Fixes & Reliability Enhancements
- **Configuration Resilience & In-Memory Preservation (`config/manager.py`)**: Fixed an issue where transient file locks, missing/empty reads, or background atomic file replaces could cause `get_config()` to evict loaded models and fall back to hardcoded defaults. The in-memory configuration is now preserved with fail-soft guarantees when the config file is temporarily unavailable.
- **Thread-Safe Atomic Config I/O**: Added thread locking (`threading.RLock`) around config load and save operations, collision-proof temporary filenames, and Windows-specific retry backoff for atomic replacements.
- **Automatic Backup Recovery**: `load_config()` automatically recovers active configurations from timestamped backups under `~/.autoconduck/backups/config/` on cold starts if `config.yaml` is missing or corrupted.
- **Provider-Aware Fallback Resolution (`config/resolver.py`, `routing/model_pool.py`, `routing/pricing.py`)**: Enhanced `resolve_orchestrator_model()` to discover provider credentials from environment variables (`LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) and fallback presets before defaulting to `gpt-4o`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-24

### Enhancements & Dynamic Model Tiering
- **Dynamic Pool-Relative Model Tiering (`routing/model_pool.py`)**: Replaced fixed static price cutoffs with pool-relative dynamic quantile partitioning. Automatically tiers models across `cheap_fast`, `balanced`, and `frontier_reasoning` based on the user's active/selected models (whether 1, 2, 3, 6, or 20+ models).
- **VCS & Git Fast-Path Intent Routing**: Explicit fast-path classification in `slm_planner.py` for git commits, diffs, status, and routine tasks, preventing runaway costs on expensive models.
- **Emoji Removal Across Logs & TUI**: Purged all emojis from logs, TUI dashboard, onboarding screens, SSE streamers, progress formatters, and CLI outputs in favor of clean bracketed ASCII markers (`[OK]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERR]`, `[..]`, `[>>]`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-24

### Major Features & Architectural Overhaul
- **Embedded SLM Task Architect**: Replaced static 10-factor regex heuristics with local Qwen 2.5 Coder 0.5B Instruct (Q4_K_M GGUF), generating typed Pydantic \ExecutionPlan\ specifications with sub-100ms inference.
- **Turn Guard Subsystem (\server/turn_guard.py\)**: Sub-2ms regex classifier providing instantaneous bypass for active tool loops and stagnation detection for automated SLM re-planning.
- **Dynamic DAG Factory (\orchestrator/dynamic_factory.py\)**: Replaced static 6-phase orchestrator with runtime compilation of tailored \StateGraph\ topologies based on plan dependency DAGs and SQLite checkpointer state persistence.
- **Knowledge Vector Store & RAG Subsystem (\knowledge/vector_store.py\)**: Embedded LanceDB vector database with fast hybrid code search and automated context distillation for complex workflows.
- **Session Lifecycle & Context Guard (\orchestrator/session_guard.py\)**: Preserves immutable prefix contract (turns 0 & 1) for maximum upstream prompt caching across 40+ turns, enforcing intelligent compaction at the 80% context window ceiling.
- **Real-Time Reasoning SSE Streamer (\server/sse_streamer.py\)**: Unified SSE streaming translating internal SLM reasoning deltas into client-compatible formats (\	hinking_delta\ for Claude Code, \delta.reasoning_content\ for OpenAI clients).
- **Autonomous 3-Tier Model Pool (outing/model_pool.py\)**: Dynamic classification into \cheap_fast\ (< .50/1M), \alanced\ (.50–.00/1M), and \rontier_reasoning\ (> .00/1M) with spend guard and degraded provider protections.
